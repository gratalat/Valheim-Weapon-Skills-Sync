This mod syncs all your weapon skills so that you can freely switch to different weapon types throughout the playthrough without worrying about having to farm levels again.
When one of your weapon skills increases, all other weapon skills will level with it.
Works with characters that haven't had the mod before, and doesn't conflict with other skill related mods.

Includes a config to exclude weapon types from the sync, and (optionally, disabled by default) sync other skill types. (read config for more info)

How it works:
When one of your skills increases, the game checks which weapon skill has the highest level, and sets all other weapons to that skill. Does not affect progress to the next level for any skill.
